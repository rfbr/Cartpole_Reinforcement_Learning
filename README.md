Introduction to reinforcement learning with TensorFlow
=
This is a quick code presenting reinforcement learning using a neural network as an agent. It was part of my bachelor's degree year-end project. I used [OpenAI cartpole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/) for the environment.

You can find the in-depth description (in French) of the code and the theory behind on the pdf. 

To launch the simulation:
```
python cartpole.py
```
The environment will be render only if the agent succeeds 500 steps in a row.
